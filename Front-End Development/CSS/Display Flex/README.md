## How to Access the Webpage Locally

If you prefer to access the webpage locally, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Project Files**: First, download all the project files, including `index.html`, `html-table.html`, `inline-block.html`, `absolute-position.html`, `float.html` and `flex.html`. You can either download them individually or as a zip archive.
2. **Locate the Files on Your Computer**: Place all the downloaded files in a folder on your computer where you'd like to access the webpage locally.
3. **Open the HTML File**: To view the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Double-clicking on the `index.html` file should automatically open it in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can right-click on the file, choose "Open with," and select your desired browser from the list.
4. **Navigate Between Pages**: On the `index.html` page, you will find links to the other HTML pages (`html-table.html`, `inline-block.html`, `absolute-position.html`, `float.html` and `flex.html`). Click on any of these links to access the corresponding HTML page and see the different methods of adding CSS in action.
5. **Relative Paths**: The links between the HTML pages (`<a>` tags) use relative paths, which means they will work as long as all the files are in the same folder. If you decide to move any of the files to a different location, ensure that the links are updated accordingly to maintain functionality.
